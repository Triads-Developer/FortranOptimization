Profiling Output Explanation

The output provided from Xcode Instruments details the runtime performance of a program, specifically showing how much time is spent in its various functions or methods. Below is a breakdown of the key terms used and how to interpret this information:

Key Terms:
Weight: Indicates the total execution time of a particular function, including the time spent in functions it calls (cumulative time).
Self Weight: Represents the time spent exclusively within the function itself, not including calls to other functions.
Symbol Name: The name of the function or method being profiled.
Understanding the Output:
mloc_g (21765): This is a high-level function or entry point in your program, with a total weight of 6.32 seconds (100% of the profiled time), but a self weight of 0 seconds, indicating that all of its time is spent in functions it calls.
uselocale: A negligible-time function (1.00 ms) with no calls to other functions.
_gfortrani_convert_real: Another quick function (1.00 ms self weight), showing time spent within the function itself.
start -> main: Indicates start called main, both having significant cumulative time (5.51 s) but no self weight, meaning their time was spent in functions they called.
MAIN__ -> mlocset_ -> ttsig_: Shows a nesting of function calls, with MAIN__ being a major computation entry point (5.49 s), eventually calling down into mlocset_ and ttsig_.
read_mnf_ -> read_mnf_13_ -> stafind_: This chain details function calls related to reading and processing data, with notable times and some self weight indicating computation time.
phreid3_, mlocinv_, dsvd_: Functions performing specific tasks, with their weights indicating the time spent in computations (e.g., dsvd_ likely refers to performing a singular value decomposition).
malloc, _malloc_zone_malloc, free, _free: Functions related to memory allocation and deallocation, highlighting areas of memory management within the program.
Analysis:
The profile provides a deep dive into where your program spends its time, pinpointing functions that are computationally expensive or called frequently. Functions with high cumulative but low self weight are top-level, calling many others. High self weight functions are key optimization targets, possibly involving algorithm optimization, function call reduction, or data and memory usage improvements.
