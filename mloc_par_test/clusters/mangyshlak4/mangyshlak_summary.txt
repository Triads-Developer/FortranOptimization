The Mangyshlak cluster is named for the sequence of three peaceful
nuclear explosions (PNEs) conducted by the former Soviet Union in
western Kazakhstan 1969 and 1970. As there is no local-distance arrival
time data the location calibration was done using the indirect
calibration method with calibration epicenters based on analysis of
satelite imagery. The analysis was confirmed and refined slightly by
site visits as described in:

"Mackey, K. G., & Bergman, E. A. (2014). Ground truth locations for the
Mangyshlak Peaceful Nuclear Explosion sequence, western Kazakhstan.
Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 104(4), 1–9."

Focal depths are set according to the shot depths reported by Sultanov
et al., 1999, corrected for the 200 m elevation of the source region.
The calibration origin times are those of Sultanov et al., 1999. The
calibrated relocation is done with fixed depth. The hypocentroid is
estimated from teleseismic P arrivals (30°-90°) using the ak135 global
model. The shift needed bring the events into close agreement with the
ground truth locations is 6.9 km at an azimuth of 65°, after which the
residuals in epicentral location range from 220 to 790 m. The origin
times determined in the relocation are shifted +0.41 s to match the
reported shot times (i.e., true travel times are shorter than ak135) and
the consistency among the three events (residuals range from -0.05 to
0.06 s) suggests that the reported shot times are accurate.
