The Wells cluster is named for the town of Wells in northeasern Nevada.
The cluster is based on a mainshock-aftershock sequence that began with
an Mw 5.8 event on February 21, 2008. Calibration, especially in depth,
is greatly aided by data from temporary seismograph stations deployed to
the source region, beginning about 2 weeks after the mainshock. The
relocation was done with free depth. This cluster includes only the
larger events that were located beyond local distances. For a
